                    <p><strong>From Inspiration to Purchase: Designing a Self-Serve Tool that Lifted Revenue by 32%.</strong> <br>
                        For millions of aspiring home decorators, Pinterest is the ultimate dream board. Yet, 80% of these users abandon their carefully curated inspirations when it's time to buy furniture, feeling their vision gets lost in translation. At Spacejoy, we saw this gap not as a failure of the user, but as a massive opportunity for innovation.</p>
                    <p>As the design lead, I spearheaded the product strategy and design for a new self-serve platform. Our goal was to bridge the emotional gap between inspiration and action by creating a "Pinterest + Canva for Home Design" experience. This new tool led to a 32% increase in e-commerce GMV, a 14% rise in conversions, and a 13% decrease in bounce rate.</p>

                    <p>Our research confirmed a painful paradox: users would spend weeks collecting pins, only to feel their involvement was "minimized" when working with designers. This frustration led them to abandon their journey and buy items piecemeal, resulting in lost sales for us.</p>
                    <p>The core user problem was clear: how can we translate a visual mood board into a real, shoppable room without losing the user's personal touch?</p>

                <p class="intro-text">Led design for an AI-powered self-serve e-commerce platform, owning end-to-end design process
                    and shaping product strategy that drove a +32% GMV lift. With closely partnering with founders I defined the roadmap 
                    and advocated for a self-serve experience addressing the 80% inspiration-to-purchase drop-off. 
                    Alongside the UX researcher, conducted 25 generative interviews and surveys that revealed DIY decorators’ “blank-canvas” intimidation, an insight 
                    that informed low-fidelity prototypes later evolved into pre-designed templates. Facilitating a Jobs-to-be-Done workshop, 
                    helped me in realigning the product vision with entire team from engagement tool to full-scale e-commerce engine. 
                    Collaborated with ML engineers to integrate YOLOv5 object detection and VGG16 style classification, 
                    transforming complex AI into intuitive, style-matched recommendations that made the experience feel effortless and intelligent.</p>

                        <p>We began with market research,surveys and about 25 generative user interviews to map behaviors and pain points.

Early feedback from concept testing was invaluable, helping us iterate on our ideas and refine our design. We created a user-friendly interface that facilitated inspiration curation, product identification, and seamless shopping within the tool.
