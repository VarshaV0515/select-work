                    <p><strong>Building from the Ground Up: A Founding Designer's Journey to a Walmart Acqui-hire.</strong><br>
                    Joining Flocare as the first design hire was more than a job. With a lean team of fewer than 10 people, we aimed to tackle some of the nagging challenges of home healthcare. 
                    My role quickly evolved beyond a traditional designer to that of a product owner and team lead, especially when our founders were away fundraising or meeting customers. 
                    This is how we went from on-the-ground research in Kansas to building an MVP that was ultimately acquired by Walmart for its engineering and customer experience capabilities.</p>

                <p>Before we could build anything, we had to understand the true nature of a home health clinician's day. The problems weren't just on the surface; they were in the small, unspoken frustrations of their workflow. 
                To uncover these, I traveled along with the founders to Kansas initially eventually Ohio to conduct "day-in-the-life" research, shadowing clinicians on their patient visits.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I observed a workflow fragmented across multiple tools: paper notes, personal diaries, phone calls, and the desktop-only EHR. 
                   Clinicians would copy patient data by hand, constantly trying to remember sensitive information to stay compliant, which added a significant cognitive load. 
                   This meticulous, observant approach was crucial. The insights from seeing this chaos firsthand were what helped shape the entire product.</p>

                      in Kansas to uncover workflow challenges, translating findings into personas, journey maps, and

                       When founders were on the road, I led product sprints and roadmap planning, effectively stepping

                    high-frequency tasks into a single, secure mobile application: basic patient information, daily schedules, and routing. 
                    To build and launch this MVP quickly, the engineering team and I made a strategic technology choice to use React Native 
                    to cater to both users on iOS and Android without having to build separately. 
                    Back in 2018, we were aware of the trade-offs but prioritized speed-to-market and 
                    building a highly functional product.</p>

                <p>Simultaneously, we identified a critical information gap between the field and the agency office. The backoffice had no real-time visibility into clinicians' schedules. To solve this, we built a simple backoffice web app that synced in real-time with the clinicians' mobile app. When a clinician updated their schedule, it was instantly reflected in the office, empowering the backoffice to handle ad-hoc patient calls effectively.</p>

                <p class="feature-header"><strong>Proactive Coordination</strong></p>
                <p> A major pain point for the care teams was the chaotic, often inefficient, back-and-forth communication between clinicians. 
                    Initially, the founders believed a full-fledged chat feature was the solution. 
                    However, based on direct conversations from users, I wasn't convinced this would solve the core issue. 
                    Field research and insights from HCI papers revealed that critical coordination details 
                    were either being lost in hundreds of messages or not communicated at all when last-minute changes were made. 
                    I compiled insights from different sources & presented my research findings to the team which led to a different approach of directly solving the root cause. 
                    If interested, read my research report here: <a href="assets/documents/Collaboration in Home Healthcare.pdf" target="_blank">Collaboration in Home Healthcare</a><br>
                    To validate a different approach, I stepped up my evaluative research and formulated proofs-of-concept 
                    that focused on proactive coordination rather than another endless chat window.</p><br>
                    Instead of a reactive chat, I designed a system that made visit schedules and relevant notes proactively available to the entire care team.  This solution centered on three key components:

            <ol class="custom-numbered-list">
                <li>Visits Schedules: All visit schedules were made instantly available to the entire care team, eliminating the need for back-and-forth communication to confirm appointments.</li>
                <li>Shared Patient Calendar: I implemented a shared patient calendar, accessible on both the main visits list and individual patient pages, creating a single source of truth for team-wide coordination.</li>
                <li>Relevant Notes: Critical notes were integrated directly into the patient notes page, ensuring that all team members had access to the same information.</li>
            </ol>
To power this, I collaborated with engineering to use GraphQL for our APIs, allowing the app to fetch specific, nested data in a single, efficient call. 
This technical choice was key to making the shared calendar fast and reliable, ensuring the data was always up-to-date. 
The final design, which prioritized clarity and proactive information sharing over a simple chat, 
was highly appreciated by the nurses for its simplicity and efficiency, ultimately solving the root cause of their coordination challenges.

                        <p>Our research showed clinicians often worked in rural areas with no reliable internet, leaving them stranded. To solve this, I collaborated with engineering to build a robust offline mode. In 2018, we made a forward-thinking decision to utilize geofencing technology. This was a sophisticated approach at the time, allowing the app to proactively pre-download route maps and critical patient information for the day, ensuring the app was always functional.</p>
