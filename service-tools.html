                    <p><strong>From Startup Agility to Enterprise Digital Transformation at Scale</strong><br>
                    After Walmart acquired Flocare, I joined their Health & Wellness team. 
                    At Flocare, I saw firsthand how replacing paper with a thoughtful digital tool could transform a nurse's daily workflow. 
                    I brought that experience with me to this project, deeply aware of the potential barriers to adoption for frontline workers. 
                    As a design lead I owned end to end design process, collaborating across team including functional leaders such as VP, operations, 
                    Product Director, Group Legal Counsel and played a key role in product strategy & design skillsets 
                    of applying that empathy to solve complex problems at an immense scale.</p>

                <p>For years, paper forms were the only feasible way to manage a mobile workforce across 2,580 Auto Care Centers. However, this legacy system had failed to evolve. Managers were not just burdened; they were constrained by a system that consumed 1-1.5 shifts daily in administrative tasks. This inefficiency was compounded by deeper, systemic issues:</p><br>
                
                <p><strong>Evolving Roles, Static Forms:</strong> As operations matured, the one-size-fits-all paper forms no longer accommodated the specific, role-based tasks that technicians and managers now performed.</p><br>
                
                <p><strong>The High Cost of Compliance:</strong> Per compliance rules, every paper form had to be physically stored for seven years. This led to operational costs and made retrieving a specific form for a legal claim a tedious, manual process that often failed.</p><br>
                
                <p><strong>Fragmented Data:</strong> Beyond paper, managers had to navigate disjointed legacy systems, making it nearly impossible to get a clear, real-time picture of scheduling, inventory, or performance.</p>
                
                <p>As one manager bluntly put it, "Storing and retrieving forms should be more efficient. Today I go through binders for hours sometimes". The workforce was ready for a digital solution, but they lacked the tools to escape this cycle of inefficiency.</p><br>

            </div>
            
            <p>To build on insights from earlier field research where we understood the personas & the surface level problems, I partnered with the Product Manager to conduct a new round of in-depth interviews. 
                This new round of interviews was crucial for building a detailed Manager Journey Map. 
                This visual artifact became our most powerful tool, clearly showing all stakeholders how every stage of the day was broken 
                by paper processes and fragmented systems.</p><br>
            
            During these conversations, we uncovered surprising complexities:<br>
            
            <p><strong>Unexpected Responsibilities:</strong> In some superstores, the ACC Manager was also responsible for the on-site gas station, a detail that significantly expanded the scope of their data needs.</p><br>
            
             <p><strong>No Two Stores Alike:</strong> A critical discovery was that nearly every ACC had a different physical layout. 
                This meant a rigid, one-size-fits-all digital solution was doomed to fail unless we built role-based task specific forms.</p><br>

                 <h4 class="section-subheading">Part 1: From Paper to Pixels - Designing the Forms Manager</h4>

                 </div>
                 
                 <p>The first mission was to tackle the staggering inefficiency of the paper-based system. Our research revealed that 25 different forms were in use, requiring approximately 1,250 manual entries. However, the rigid nature of these forms created significant shortcomings for managers, including redundant evaluations and accountability gaps.</p><br>
                 
                 <p><strong>A Strategy for Prioritization:</strong> To solve this, I helped facilitate in-depth discussions with managers. We collectively agreed on two powerful criteria for prioritization: daily user impact and legal risk. This framework was critical; it helped us align all stakeholders on the six essential forms for our MVP.</p><br>
                 
                 <p><strong>Winning Over Stakeholders:</strong> The legal team was initially hesitant. I set up one-on-one sessions to walk them through prototypes of the secure, cloud-based system. By demonstrating how the digital version was actually more secure and auditable than paper, I was able to get their essential buy-in.</p><br>
                 
                 <p><strong>Solving for Complex Edge Cases:</strong> For technician certifications, I designed an interim solution: a feature that allowed managers to simply upload a photo of a completed physical form. This pragmatic approach ensured compliance without forcing redundant work on users.</p><br>

            </div>
             
             <p>With the form system underway, the next challenge was to address the fragmented data landscape. Our research confirmed that managers had to access several different tools and systems just to get a snapshot of their business.</p><br>
             
             <p><strong>A Direct Mandate from Users:</strong> Our interviews revealed a clear and immediate need for an "all in one single glance" dashboard. Managers were manually tracking key metrics, with one stating, "I still need to use the calculator for division level information", highlighting the manual effort required.</p><br>
             
             <p><strong>A Frugal, User-Centric Approach:</strong> The research also uncovered that store-level managers and strategic leaders had vastly different data needs. Instead of building a one-size-fits-all dashboard, I designed a solution with an ad-hoc report generation feature. This allowed specific roles to pull deep-dive data on-demand while keeping the main dashboard focused on the core needs of our primary users.</p><br>

                     <p><strong>Full Deployment:</strong> The solution was rolled out to all 2,580 Auto Care Centers, eventually reaching ~11,000 form users and ~4,000 dashboard users nationwide.</p><br>
                     
                     <p>Throughout this process, we gathered real-world feedback and made critical refinements, such as separating role-based content within forms and adding a "Start New Form" feature to accommodate real-world evaluation scenarios.</p><br>
